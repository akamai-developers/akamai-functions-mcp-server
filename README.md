## 🛑 Prerequisites

Before adding the server to your AI client, ensure your local environment is ready:

1. **Plugin Installed**: You need the `aka` plugin for Spin:

    ```bash
    spin plugin install aka --yes
    ```

2. **Login Required**: You must be authenticated via the `aka` plugin for `spin:

    ```bash
    spin aka login
    ```

## 📦 Installation

### Install the latest version of the plugin

The latest stable release of the `akamai-functions-mcp` plugin can be installed like so:

```bash
spin plugins update
spin plugin install akamai-functions-mcp
```

### Install the canary version of the plugin

The canary release of the `akamai-functions-mcp` represents the most recent commits on main and may not be stable, with some features still in progress.

```bash
spin plugins install --url https://github.com/ThorstenHans/akamai-functions-mcp-server/releases/download/canary/gh.json
```

### Install from a local build

Alternatively, use the `spin pluginify` plugin to install from a fresh build. This will use the `pluginify` manifest (`spin-pluginify.toml`) to package the plugin and proceed to install it:

```bash
spin plugins install pluginify
go build -o akamai-functions-mcp main.go
spin pluginify --install
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

To let your AI Assistant use the server, add the `spin` command to your configuration.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "akamai-functions": {
      "command": "spin",
      "args": ["akamai-functions-mcp"]
